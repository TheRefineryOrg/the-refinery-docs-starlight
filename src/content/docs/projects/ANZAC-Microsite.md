# ANZAC Microsite Documentation

The ANZAC Microsite is a specialized web project that leverages modern development practices and technologies, hosted on the Vercel platform and integrated with GitHub for continuous integration (CI). This documentation provides an overview of the project setup, technologies used, and guidelines on how to contribute to the microsite.

## Project Details

- **Job Number**: J1873
- **Campaign Name**: RSL Vic ANZAC Appeal ATL Campaign
- **Hosting**: Deployed and hosted on Vercel.
- **Source Repository**: Available on GitHub under the account [TheRefineryOrg](https://github.com/TheRefineryOrg).

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: Utilized as the web framework for its efficient rendering capabilities.
- **Svelte**: Employed for creating interactive components and enhancing the user interface.
- **Content Management**: Currently, the site content is hardcoded, pending future updates for dynamic management.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Changes pushed to the GitHub repository automatically trigger a CI pipeline that builds and deploys the microsite to Vercel. This ensures that the live site reflects the latest updates after successful CI checks.

## Getting Started

To contribute to the ANZAC Microsite, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheRefineryOrg/ANZAC-Microsite.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ANZAC-Microsite
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Apply changes to the Markdown content or source code as necessary.

5. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository. The CI pipeline will handle the subsequent build and deployment to Vercel.
